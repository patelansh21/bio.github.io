				<h3> Magazine Cover </h3>
				<img src="Magazinecover.png" alt="Magazine Cover" style="width: 250px; height: 300px;">
				<figcaption> This was the 3rd project we did in photoshop by ourself. First we created a background, add our image,
				and added text according what you wanted to have on your magazine cover. It was fun making the magazine cover but hard
				to find a picture of ourself. Overall got to learn new things in photoshop for example; creating shadow, puppet wrap of
				image and masking text with an image.

				<h3> Gif Creation </h3>
				<img src="AnshGifCreation.gif" alt="story board" style="width: 250px; height: 150px;">
				<figcaption> This was the 4th project we did in photoshop by ourself. In this gif creation project we added 4-5 images
				from web that we liked most as my favorite was car images then, we took those 4-5 images and added them to all different
				layers then, added text to all images and finally, make a timeline from frames and added all layers to frame to make it look
				like a gif and arrange them & changed time for how long we wanted each frame to be shown. It was good experience making this gif
				project.

				<h3> Story board (group) </h3>
				<img src="Storyboard.gif" alt="Story board" style="width: 250px; height: 200px;">
				<figcaption> This was the 5th and last project we did in photoshop in group. In this group gif creation project there were 2
				groups of 2 people and each group made a gif and then we connected the 2 gif created by 2 group to 1 gif. It was hard
				to find a way to connect the 2 gif into 1 as both were 2 different ideas, but it went all good. The other used tablet
				to make hand drawn image and we used image from web to create our gif as it was mixture of 2 different things to 1 gif.
				We added effects, stroke and added dialogs to it. In this story board project we made a daaily life of 1 person doing in 
				his day at end watching T.V. and comes a transition of our gif project as it was animation perfectly match to it.

				<h3> Collage </h3>
				<img src="Collage.png" alt="Collage" style="width: 250px; height: 150px;">
				<figcaption> This was the 2nd project we did in photoshop by ourself. In this project we took 3-4 images from web related
				to each other so we can create a collage. Then, we add all image to different layers and removed all unwanted parts
				from the image that were not necessary. We used patch - content aware tool to blend the background so it look like
				it was a 1 image. It was our 2 project and new to photoshop so it didn't go as I thought but it was great at the end.
				The collage was of playing cricket. First, I got image from web of batsman, ball and wicketkeeper. Then, added them in 
				layers and removed unwanted parts from it. Finally, merege them to 1 layer and blend it with background to make it look
